# 🎯 W02 Group Project: Setup, Planning, and Brainstorming

## 👥 Team Members
- Josue Neiculeo
- Cristobal Baeriswyl 

##  Meeting Summary
Our team met to discuss the upcoming .NET Blazor group project.   
Each member shared insights from the week's tutorials and learning activities.  
We discussed how Blazor allows web apps to use C# for both front-end and back-end logic, making development more unified.  

We then brainstormed potential project ideas, considering both creativity and scope.  
The team also created our shared GitHub repository and Trello board to manage progress.  
We agreed to meet weekly to track milestones, assign tasks, and help each other with code reviews.  

### Key Decisions:
- **Repository created and cloned** by all members.
- **Trello board** set up for task management.
- **Next step:** Choose a final project from our proposals and begin initial setup in Blazor.
